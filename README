wmII - weewx driver for Davis Weather Monitor II weather stations

This driver was derived from the weeWX Ultimeter driver.
Most methods were adapted from The Weather Update app written by Scott Hassan.
His software is licensed under the PSF License: http://www.dotfunk.com/projects/weatherupdate/

It should also work with Wizzard and Perception stations but that hasn't been tested since I don't own any.

================================================================================
Thanks Jay R. Jaeger for Adapting it for Python 3 (June, 2021)
REQUIRES: Python3 (tested under 3.8), weewx Version 4 (or later)

================================================================================
Installation:

Download the wmII.py file and copy it to your weeWX user directory.
In Debian it is: /usr/share/weeWX/user

You could install the driver by using git to pull the files into the weewx user folder:
    git init
    git remote add origin https://github.com/jardiamj/wmII
    git pull origin master

Restart weewx and then run: wee_config --reconfigure
Select the wmII driver when prompted, it'll then ask for the port the station is connected to,
the defaul port is /dev/ttyUSB0 (my system).
The configuration section for wmII will be appended to the end of /etc/weewx/weewx.conf file

-------------------------Manuall configuration-------------------------------------------
you could also manually modify your /etc/weewx/weewx.conf to use the wmII driver by selecting:
station-type = wmII under [Station]:

[Station]  
    ...
    # Set to type of station hardware. There must be a corresponding stanza
    # in this file with a 'driver' parameter indicating the driver to be used.
    station_type = wmII

Add a section in the weewx.conf file for the wmII driver, it should look like this:
[wmII]
    # This section is for the weewx weather station Davis Weather Monitor II

    # model = station model, e.g., 'Weather Monitor II' or 'Wizard III'
    # [Optional. Default is 'Weather Monitor II']
    model = Weather Monitor II

    # The time (in seconds) between LOOP packets.
    loop_interval = 2

    # The driver to use:
    driver = user.wmII
    # Port to be used
    type = serial
    port = /dev/ttyUSB0
